## Description

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, following lung cancer, as of 2024. Conventional cancer diagnosis relies on manual examination of biopsied tissues by pathologists, a time-consuming process that can vary based on the pathologistâ€™s experience.

Early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for effective treatment planning and patient care. The invention of whole-slide scanners has revolutionized this process by enabling the use of Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems for automated analysis.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within CAD systems play a pivotal role in the automated classification of breast tissues. This study utilizes state-of-the-art CNN architectures, EfficientNetV1 and EfficientNetV2, to perform binary classification on the BreakHis dataset, which consists of histopathological images categorized as benign and malignant breast tissues.

To improve classification performance, an ensemble method combining EfficientNetV1 and EfficientNetV2 models is applied, resulting in enhanced accuracy and reliability.
